This git is currently ongoing build-related changes. We are moving from a build environment where all plugins are build as separate projects
into a autotools build which builds all plugins at the same go. Therefore there are files that still exists in this git but that are to be
considered as obsolete. Such files includes, but might nog be restricted to, build files such as build-android.sh etc. in respective projects.

The new build uses build.sh and setup-env.sh in the root folder as well as configure.ac in the root folder. Then Makefile.am's are used in
all different projects to create Makefiles.

In the long run this should be fixed so that openwebrtc-gst-plugins is a autotool build and nothing else.
